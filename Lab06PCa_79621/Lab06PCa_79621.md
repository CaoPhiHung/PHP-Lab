#### Evaluation of lab and in class assignments

*A note on Labs* - Please be advised most labs will be marked on a sliding scale as they will vary in terms of the amount of artifacts required for submission as well as the difficulty of the lab.  Typically in class labs are marked as follows unless otherwise specified.

| Mark | Comment |
| --- | --- |
| 1 - Partial | Lab partially complete, minimal understanding and execution and concepts demonstrated items missing or incomplete from submission. |
| 2 - General | Lab mostly complete requirements, minor errors present, full submission. |
| 3 - Full | Lab fully complete, concepts and execution demonstrate mastery.  No errors present in submission. |

 Please be sure to follow the Markdown convention and that your document is formatted properly.  There are a few variations of the Markdown format but I will generally be using VSCode to view your files.
